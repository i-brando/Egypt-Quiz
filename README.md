Egypt Quiz

Overview
The Egypt Quiz is an interactive C# application designed to test and expand the user's knowledge about Egypt. This project demonstrates my ability to build engaging and dynamic quiz applications using structured programming, user interface design, and file handling techniques. Initially created as a coursework project, it now serves as an example of my programming skills and understanding of application flow.

The quiz allows users to:

Answer a variety of questions about Egypt, displayed randomly for a unique experience each time.
View visual aids accompanying each question to enhance engagement.
Use helpful features like hints, passing questions, and returning to skipped questions.
Learn interesting facts about Egypt through detailed explanations provided with each correct answer.
The program also tracks and displays the user’s score dynamically, creating a fun and educational challenge.

Key Features

Core Functionality:

Main Menu:
Provides easy navigation to start the quiz or exit the program.
Allows users to return to the main menu at any time.

Randomized Questions:
Presents 10 or more questions in a random order for replayability.
Displays relevant images for each question to make the experience interactive.

Interactive Feedback:
Confirms correct answers with positive reinforcement.
Shows the correct answer and a fact when the user answers incorrectly.
Updates and displays the score dynamically after each question.

Pass and Skip:
Includes a "pass" option, allowing users to skip a question and revisit it later in the quiz.

Enhanced Features:

Hints and Scoring:
Provides optional hints for difficult questions, deducting points for their use.

Completion Summary:
Displays the user’s total score upon completing or exiting the quiz.

User Experience:
Includes an exit button for quick termination of the game.
Maintains user engagement through educational feedback on each answer.

Programming Principles Demonstrated

Randomization and Control Flow:
Randomizes question order, ensuring each session is unique.

Dynamic UI Updates:
Implements dynamic scoring and feedback systems.

Data Validation and Interaction:
Ensures valid user inputs and handles scenarios like skipped questions.

Modular Design:
Breaks functionality into reusable, maintainable methods.

File and Resource Handling:
Integrates image files for a visually engaging quiz experience.

Logical Game Flow:
Handles question sequencing, skipping, and revisiting seamlessly.

This project reflects my ability to create an engaging educational application while showcasing my technical skills in programming logic, user interaction, and application structure. Check out the codebase to see these principles in action!
